* support for swiss qr bill with reference number
* manage payments for bills
* reading camt.054 payment files (in connection with qr bills and refnumer)

## Installation

Install juntagrico-billing via pip
`pip install juntagrico-billing`

or add it to your main django projects `requirements.txt`:
`juntagrico-billing`

You may also install from github source (or add it to `requirements.txt`):
`pip install git+https://github.com/juntagrico/juntagrico-billing.git`

In your `juntagrico.settings.py` add `juntagrico_billing`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'juntagrico',
    ...
    'juntagrico_billing',
```

In your urls.py you also need to add the new pattern:
```python
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    re_path(r'^',include('juntagrico_billing.urls')),
]
```

As the billing app introduces its own database tables, you need to apply migrations after installing.
Execute `python manage.py migrate` in your main django project.

## Create settings object

`juntagrico-billing` uses a singleton `Settings` object to store some setting.
You need to create this settings object once in django admin.

- Log in to juntagrico and go to the admin UI at `https://<my juntagrico site>/admin`.
- You should see in admin a new section for juntagrico_billing

- Add a new Settings object

- You need to specify a debtors account, just specify any digit code (e.g. `1100`)
- A default paymenttype is mandatory too. You may create one directly from the settings dialog:

- Save your settings object. There must be only one settings object.

## Create a business year

Billing is done on the base of a business-year. A business-year denotes the time period for creating bills.
Usually this will correspond to a calendar year (1.1 - 31.1 of a year). It is possible to use different timespans though.
Business-years should be consecutive.

Business years are managed in django admin UI. 

- Log in to `/admin` and create a new businessyear object

## Billing

Billing is based on the activation and deactivation dates of subscriptions (and extrasubscriptions) in juntagrico.
At any time you may create all needed invoices (bills) for a certain business-year.

In juntagrico you should see the `Bills and Bookkeeping` Menu, if you are assigned bookkeeping rights.

Go to `Bills` and choose the desired business-year.
Switch to the `Generate bills` tab. The amount of pending bills for the businessyear should then be displayed.
This may take some time depending on the number of subscriptions and members in your system.

Pressing the `Generate` button will create these bills.
They may be viewed afterwards on the `all` tab of the bills list.

### Modifying or adding bills

There are two modes to view an existing bill object:
- admin view of the bill. click on the first column of a bill row to open the bill in django admin.
- user view of the bill. click on the last columdn of a bill row to open the bill as the user will see it.

If a bill created via `Generate` is incorrect, proceed as follows:
- delete the bill in the django admin UI
- correct the subscription settings
  - in most cases this will involve adjusting the activation or deactivation date of the subscription / extrasubscription
- re-create the bill by going to the `Generate bills` tab on the `Bills` list.
  - if you only modified one subscription, it should say `1 pending bill`
  - click on `Generate` to re-create the bill based on the modified settings

The same procedure applies if a new subscription or subscription part (extrasubscription) is added after bills for a business-year have been generated.
If there already is a bill for the same member and you want the additional parts to appear on the same bill, you may delete the existing bill and regenerate it like described above.
Deleting a bill is only possible if there are no payments on it.
If you add parts without deleting an existing bill, then a new bill will be added for the member.

### Adding custom items to a bill

In addition to subscription and extrasubscription parts, a bill may also contain custom items.
Custom items may be used for stuff like
- correcting overpaid bills
- adding special credit for a certain member (work instead of paying)
- adding additional contributions (solidarity contributions)

For each kind of custom item you need to define a custom Bill item type in django admin:

You need to specify a description and a booking account for the custom item type.

You may then add custom item types on a bill in the django admin view of the bill:
